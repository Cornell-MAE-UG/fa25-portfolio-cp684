#### Constraints/Objectives
I was tasked with designing an apparatus that utilizes an actuator, a rigid beam, and pins to lift the heaviest possible weight to the highest possible height. This is to be done in a 150 cm by 50 cm, 2-D space.

#### Design Degrees of Freedom
Because of the pins put in place, there are no translational degrees of freedom. There is 1 rotational degree of freedom in the k̂ direction.

#### Static Analysis
