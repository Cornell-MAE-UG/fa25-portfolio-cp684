As part of a class project, we were tasked with designing an apparatus that utilized an actuator and a beam to move a mass. The objective was to optimize the weight of the mass as well as the height that the mass is elevated to. We were given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a rigid bar of a fixed length of our choice, 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground and a linear actuator.


I decided to use the RSX actuator because it was capable of producing the greatest amount of force of 294 kN, as well as having the largest stroke legnth of 1.5 meters.


Knowing how the sum of moments about a point is 0 in static equilibrium, by placing the actuator at a far distance from the pivot point, I can significantly increase the moment production by placing the mass at a closer distance from the pivot point. I know this because force (mass) = force (actuator) * distance (actuator) / distance (mass).
