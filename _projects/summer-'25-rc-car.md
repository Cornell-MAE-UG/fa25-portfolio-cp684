#### Introduction
I was inspired to design and build a 1/10 RC crawler without prior knowledge not only for the experience gained from working on a four-wheel vehicle, but also to challenge myself to learn something completely new, problem-solve, and adapt to unforeseen circumstances. My overall objective was to build a crawler that maximizes speed without sacrificing durability or performance. Another goal was to not exceed a budget of $200, so thorough research and trade studies were conducted.

#### Research
Because of my lack of prior knowledge, I dedicated most of my time with this project on learning what components are needed to build an RC car, what purposes they served, how they functioned, and what specifications I would need to accomplish my goal.                                                       
The electric components follow a system going from the battery to the ESC, which then distributes power to two parts: the receiver and the motor. Connected to the receiver is the servo which serves as the main mechanism to control steering. Lithium polymer batteries are more applicable than other types because it is rechargable. In order to gain more speed, I would need a higher voltage output from my battery. Therefore, I picked a 3S battery over a 3P battery. 5200 mAh means that the battery has the capacity to provide a constant 5.2 amperes for 1 hour. 50C represents the battery's ability to safely discharge 50 times the battery's capacity, ensuring that th. The ESC has 60A meaning that it can safely deliver up to 60 amperes to other components. It was important for the battery's C value to be higher than the ESC's A value to ensure that the components don't get overloaded. The servo has the strength to produce 35 kg or 350 N of force, allowing controlled steering at high speeds.
The mechanical components support a front-wheel drive chassis, connecting the motor to a transmission and drive train, then axle and tires. I decided to use a brushless motor (3650, 3900 KV) because of its higher efficiency. 3650 represents the dimensions of the motor, meaning that the diamter is 36 mm and the length is 50 mm. This size is considerably smaller than other motors for 1/10 crawlers, allowing me to minimize the weight. 3900 KV means that for every 1 volt put into the motor, it will rotate at 3900 rpm, which is considered a high KV for most RC cars.

#### Build
Carbon fiber frame

Transmitter and receiver                                                        
Brushless motor: 3650, 3900 KV                                                  
Transmission                                                                    
Drive shaft: 86-105 mm                                                          
Axles                                                                           
Tires                                                                           
Spring suspension

#### Modifications
In order to maximize the efficiency of energy from the transmission to the axle, the angle between the drive shaft and the horizontal axis must be as close to zero as possible. However, due to the placement of the parts, the drive shaft's shortest length was too long to allow better connection. To fix this, I measured the distance between the transmission and axle at their ideal positions, then cut off the excess length from the drive shaft. This resulted in a much smoother rotation.

#### Results
Total weight: 2.22 kg/5 lbs                                                      
Reduced vehicle weight by 15% through the use of a carbon fiber frame and chassis component substitutions.                                             
Achieved 150% increase in top speed (from ~8 mph to ~20 mph) while maintaining acceptable thermal and handling characteristics.
