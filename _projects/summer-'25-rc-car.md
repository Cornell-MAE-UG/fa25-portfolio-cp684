#### Introduction:
I was inspired to design and build a 1/10 RC crawler without prior knowledge not only for the experience gained from working on a four-wheel vehicle, but also to challenge myself to learn something completely new, problem-solve, and adapt to unforeseen circumstances. My overall objective was to build a crawler that maximizes speed without sacrificing durability or performance. Another goal was to not exceed a budget of $200, so thorough research and trade studies were conducted.                                                                  

#### Research:
Lithium polymer batteries are better than other types because it is rechargable. A 3S battery is more efficient than a battery with cells in parallel because of the higher voltage it produces necessary for speed.

#### Build:
Carbon fiber frame                                                              
Lithium polymer battery: 3S, 5200 mAh, 50 C                                     
ESC: 2-3S, 60 A                                                                 
Servos: 35 kg                                                                   
Transmitter and receiver                                                        
Brushless motor: 3650, 3900 KV                                                  
Transmission                                                                    
Drive shaft: 86-105 mm                                                          
Axles                                                                           
Tires                                                                           
Spring suspension

#### Modifications:
In order to maximize the efficiency of energy from the transmission to the axle, the angle between the drive shaft and the horizontal axis must be as close to zero as possible. However, due to the placement of the parts, the drive shaft's shortest length was too long to allow better connection. To fix this, I measured the distance between the transmission and axle at their ideal positions, then cut off the excess length from the drive shaft. This results in a much smoother rotation.

#### Results:
Total weight: 2.23 kg/5 lbs
