#### Introduction:
I was inspired to design and build a 1/10 RC crawler without prior knowledge not only for the experience gained from working on a four-wheel vehicle, but also to challenge myself to learn something completely new, problem-solve, and adapt to unforeseen circumstances. My overall objective was to build a crawler that maximizes speed without sacrificing durability or performance. Another goal was to not exceed a budget of $200, so thorough research and trade studies were conducted.

#### Research:
The electric components follow a system going from the battery to the ESC, which then distributes power to two parts: the receiver and the motor. The receiver is what allows the user to send signals to communicate with the crawler and control it. Connected to the receiver is the servo which serves as the main mechanism to control steering. Lithium polymer batteries are better than other types because it is rechargable. A 3S battery is more efficient than a battery with cells in parallel because of the higher voltage it produces necessary for speed. 5200 mAh means that the battery has the capacity to provide a constant 5.2 amperes for 1 hour. 50C represents the battery's ability to safely discharge 50 times the battery's capacity. The ESC has 60A meaning that it can safely deliver up to 60 amperes to other components. The servo has the strength to produce 35 kg or 350 N of force.                    


#### Build:
Carbon fiber frame                                                              
Lithium polymer battery: 3S, 5200 mAh, 50C                                     
ESC: 2-3S, 60 A                                                                 
Servo: 35 kg                                                                    
Transmitter and receiver                                                        
Brushless motor: 3650, 3900 KV                                                  
Transmission                                                                    
Drive shaft: 86-105 mm                                                          
Axles                                                                           
Tires                                                                           
Spring suspension

#### Modifications:
In order to maximize the efficiency of energy from the transmission to the axle, the angle between the drive shaft and the horizontal axis must be as close to zero as possible. However, due to the placement of the parts, the drive shaft's shortest length was too long to allow better connection. To fix this, I measured the distance between the transmission and axle at their ideal positions, then cut off the excess length from the drive shaft. This results in a much smoother rotation.

#### Results:
Total weight: 2.22 kg/5 lbs                                                      
Reduced vehicle weight by 15% through the use of a carbon fiber frame and chassis component substitutions.                                             
Achieved 150% increase in top speed (from ~8 mph to ~20 mph) while maintaining acceptable thermal and handling characteristics.
