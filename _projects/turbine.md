#### Synopsis
A modern gas turbine operates by drawing in air through a compressor that raises its pressure, sending this high-pressure into a combustion chamber where fuel is burned to produce extremely hot, expanding gases that then pass through turbine blades, cuasing them to spin and proudce external work.

#### Equations
Assuming steady state, adiabatic, and ΔPE is negligible:
m_in = m_out = m
E = -W + m(h_in + |v_in|^2/2 - h_out - |v_out|^2/2)
S = m(s_in - s_out) + σ

#### Improvements
By increasing the turbine inlet temperature and improving the cooling system, power output and thermal efficiency can both increase.
